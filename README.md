## ٩(⁎❛ᴗ❛⁎)۶ About the project

This repository contains a simple calculator web application built using React, JavaScript and [Mathjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjs). The application provides basic arithmetic functionality, allowing users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. It also includes error handling for invalid input.

## (ﾉ ◕ ヮ ◕)ﾉ\*:･ﾟ ✧ Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The calculator has a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to input and evaluate mathematical expressions.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Users can perform standard arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling**: The application handles errors gracefully, providing informative alerts for scenarios such as incomplete expressions or invalid operations.
